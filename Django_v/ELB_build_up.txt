All files except 'requirements.txt', folder .ebextensions and folder templates in this folder are created when the application was first built by Django.

requirements.txt determines which package to install on the EC2 instances that run this application.

In folder .ebextensions, we stored the file django.config, setting specifies the location of the WSGI script that Elastic Beanstalk uses to start the application.

ELB is built in the first Django folder, creating public URL: http://twittermap.nfvaftgznc.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
